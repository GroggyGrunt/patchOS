This package is only necessary because `qmake` will not run properly inside an amrv7 emulated container.  
`qmake` cannot find its modules, and the build fails. No one on the entire intenret has reported the same problem.  
If there are any chance of doing the full jacktrip build with qmake inside an armv7 emulated container â€“ please let me know!
